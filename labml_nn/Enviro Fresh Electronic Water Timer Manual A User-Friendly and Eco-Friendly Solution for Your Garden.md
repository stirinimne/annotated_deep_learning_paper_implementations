# How to Use the Enviro Fresh Electronic Water Timer for Your Garden
 
If you are looking for a way to save water and time in your garden, you might want to consider the Enviro Fresh Electronic Water Timer. This device is a programmable water timer that attaches to your outdoor faucet and controls the water flow to your sprinkler or irrigation system. You can set up different watering schedules for different days of the week, and adjust the duration and frequency of each watering cycle. You can also use the manual mode to turn on the water whenever you need it, or the rain delay mode to pause the watering for up to 72 hours. Here are some steps on how to use the Enviro Fresh Electronic Water Timer for your garden.
 
1. Install the battery. The Enviro Fresh Electronic Water Timer requires one 9V alkaline battery (not included) to operate. To install the battery, open the battery compartment on the back of the timer by sliding it down. Insert the battery according to the polarity markings, and close the compartment.
2. Attach the timer to your faucet. Make sure your faucet is turned off before attaching the timer. Screw the timer onto your faucet by hand, making sure it is tight and secure. Do not use any tools or over-tighten the timer, as this may damage it.
3. Connect your hose or irrigation system to the timer. Attach your hose or irrigation system to the outlet of the timer by hand, making sure it is tight and secure. Do not use any tools or over-tighten the connection, as this may damage it.
4. Set the current time and day. To set the current time and day, press and hold the SET button until the hour flashes on the LCD screen. Use the + and - buttons to adjust the hour, then press SET again to confirm. Repeat this process for the minutes, AM/PM, and day of the week.
5. Set your watering schedule. To set your watering schedule, press and hold the PROGRAM button until PROGRAM 1 appears on the LCD screen. Use the + and - buttons to select which days of the week you want to water (you can choose from every day, every other day, every third day, or specific days). Press PROGRAM again to confirm. Then use the + and - buttons to set the start time of your first watering cycle, and press PROGRAM again to confirm. Repeat this process for the duration and frequency of your first watering cycle (you can choose from 1 minute to 6 hours for duration, and from every hour to every 12 hours for frequency). Press PROGRAM again to confirm and move on to PROGRAM 2. You can set up to four different programs for each day of the week.
6. Start your watering. To start your watering, turn on your faucet fully and make sure there are no leaks in your connections. The timer will automatically follow your watering schedule and turn on and off the water according to your settings. You can check the LCD screen to see which program is running, how much time is left for each cycle, and how much battery power is remaining.

You can also use some additional features of the Enviro Fresh Electronic Water Timer for your convenience.
