The game allows players to choose from various characters from the Sonic franchise, such as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Shadow, Silver, Blaze, and more. Some characters from other franchises, such as Mario and Ichigo from Bleach, are also unlockable. The game features different modes, such as story mode, training mode, and battle mode, where players can fight against each other or against computer-controlled opponents.
 
The game has received positive feedback from fans for its graphics, gameplay, and music. Some fans have also praised the game for its originality and creativity. The game can be downloaded for free from the SAGE website or from YouTube videos that showcase the game.
  
However, the game also has a dark side. In 2017, it was discovered that the game contained a malicious DRM software that connected the player's computer to the creator's computer and gave them access to their files and webcam. The DRM software also detected if the player tried to look for cheats or hacks for the game and punished them by altering the game into a creepy version with distorted graphics, sounds, and text. The game also displayed threatening messages and images on the player's screen, such as "I AM GOD" and "YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME".
 
The DRM software was widely criticized by fans and media outlets for being invasive, unethical, and potentially illegal. The game was banned from several websites and forums, and many players deleted the game from their computers. The creator of the game, Leemena Dan, did not respond to the controversy or explain their motives for adding the DRM software. Some fans speculated that the creator was trying to prevent cheating or piracy, while others suggested that they were trolling or experimenting with the players.
 
Sonic Gather Battle is a game that has both impressed and horrified fans of Sonic. It is a game that showcases the creativity and passion of fan-made projects, but also the dangers and risks of downloading unknown software. It is a game that has become infamous for its hidden virus and its creepy transformation. It is a game that has left a mark on the Sonic fan community.
