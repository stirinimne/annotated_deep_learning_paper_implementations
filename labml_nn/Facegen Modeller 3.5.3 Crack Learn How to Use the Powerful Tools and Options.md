FaceGen Modeller 3.5.3 is a powerful tool that allows you to design human faces in 3D environment. You can generate faces from one or more photos, or at random, or using 3D scan data. You can also modify faces using over 150 controls, including click-and-drag, and apply expression morphs and accessory models[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to create realistic faces with FaceGen Modeller 3.5.3 in a few simple steps.
 
1. Download and install FaceGen Modeller 3.5.3 from the official website[^1^]. You can choose from different versions depending on your needs and budget. The demo version is free but has some limitations, such as no export to 3D formats and logo on face. The core version costs $299 and has all the basic features. The pro version costs $699 and adds more functionality, such as numeric edit boxes, CSV exports, Daz Genesis export and 3D print meshes. The enterprise version costs $1,395 and includes FaceGen Customizer and Integration Tools, as well as redistribution license.
2. Launch FaceGen Modeller 3.5.3 and select File > New to generate a random face. You can also select File > Open Photo(s) to import one or more photos of a person and let FaceGen Modeller automatically create a face from them. Alternatively, you can select File > Open Scan Data to import 3D scan data of a face.
3. Adjust the features of the face using the sliders on the left panel. You can select and customize race, gender, caricature, age and race morphing[^1^]. You can also use the mouse to click-and-drag on the face to fine-tune the shape and position of the facial features.
4. Apply a skin texture to the face using the Texture tab on the left panel. You can choose from different skin types, colors, tones and details[^1^]. You can also import your own texture maps or edit the existing ones using external image editors.
5. Apply expression morphs and accessory models using the Expression tab on the left panel. You can choose from over 110 morph targets, including the entire Facial Action Coding System (FACS)[^1^]. You can also import your own expression morphs or accessory models or edit the existing ones using external editors.
6. Change the viewing mode according to your preference using the View menu on the top bar. You can switch between diffuse shading and texture mode, background color or photo, lighting options and light sources[^1^]. You can also change the camera mode from perspective mode to orthographic mode using the Camera menu on the top bar.
7. Export your face to a 3D format using the File > Export menu on the top bar. You can choose from different formats, such as Collada (DAE), Filmbox (FBX), 3D Studio (3DS), Maya ASCII (ma), Lightwave 6.x LWO2 (LWO), Wavefront (OBJ), Softimage dotXSI 3.0 (XSI), VRML 97 (WRL) or STL[^1^]. You can also export your texture maps to PNG, JPEG, TGA or BMP[^1^].
