Updating your Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX navigation CD-ROM is important to ensure that you have the latest road information and avoid getting lost or taking wrong turns. However, finding the right update CD can be tricky, as there are different versions and regions available. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to update your Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX navigation CD-ROM for Ford.
  
## Step 1: Identify Your Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX Version
  
The first step is to identify which version of the Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX navigation system you have. You can do this by checking the label on the front of the unit or by pressing the MENU button and selecting SYSTEM INFO. You should see a model number and a software version on the screen. For example, if your model number is 7 612 300 512 and your software version is 5.0A, then you have a Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX (VX) system.
  
## Step 2: Choose Your Update CD
  
The next step is to choose the update CD that matches your Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX version and your region. You can find various update CDs online from websites like NavMapStore.com[^1^] or eBay[^3^]. You should look for CDs that have the latest map data and software updates for your system. For example, if you have a Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX (VX) system and you live in Germany, you should look for a CD that has the TomTom 2020 V17 Maps for Germany[^1^]. You can also choose CDs that cover multiple countries or regions, such as Benelux, Alps, UK and Ireland, Scandinavia, Italy, France, Portugal and Spain[^1^]. Make sure that the CD you choose is compatible with your system and has a valid part number.
  
## Step 3: Install Your Update CD
  
The final step is to install your update CD into your Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX navigation system. To do this, you need to follow these instructions:
  
- Turn on your car ignition and your Blaupunkt TravelPilot EX unit.
- Eject the current CD from the unit and insert the update CD.
- Wait for the unit to recognize the update CD and display a message asking if you want to update.
- Select YES to start the update process.
- Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the update to complete.
- Eject the update CD and insert your original CD or another audio CD.
- Restart your unit and check if the update was successful.
