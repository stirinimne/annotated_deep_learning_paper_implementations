If you love taking selfies in Sims 4, you might have noticed that the default poses and animations are not very realistic or varied. You might also want to use different devices, such as iPhones, flip phones, or even headphones, to take selfies with your sims. Fortunately, there are some amazing mods that can override the default selfie poses and animations and make them more natural and diverse. In this article, we will show you some of the best selfie override mods for Sims 4 and how to use them.
  
## What are Selfie Override Mods?
 
Selfie override mods are custom content that replace the default selfie poses and animations in Sims 4 with new ones. They can also change the appearance of the devices that sims use to take selfies, such as phones, cameras, or headphones. Some of these mods are standalone, meaning they only affect one type of selfie, while others are comprehensive, meaning they affect multiple types of selfies. Some of these mods also require other mods or packs to work properly.
