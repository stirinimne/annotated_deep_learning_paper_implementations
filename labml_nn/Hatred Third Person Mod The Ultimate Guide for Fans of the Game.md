Hatred is a violent and controversial game that puts you in the role of a mass murderer who wants to unleash his hatred on humanity. The game was originally released in 2015 and featured a top-down perspective that emphasized the brutality and gore of the protagonist's actions. However, some fans of the game wanted to experience the game in a different way, and created mods that allowed them to play Hatred in third person mode.
 
One of the most popular mods for Hatred is the Death Dealer Mod, which was created by a user named Vergil. This mod not only changes the camera angle to third person, but also adds new features and improvements to the game, such as:

The Death Dealer Mod is not for the faint of heart, as it makes Hatred even more violent and graphic than before. The mod also does not promote any political or ideological views, and does not condone the actions of the protagonist or anyone who commits such atrocities. It is meant for entertainment purposes only, and you are responsible for your own actions both in the game and in real life.
  
However, not everyone is a fan of Hatred and its third person mod. The game has received a lot of criticism and controversy for its violent and nihilistic premise, as well as its graphic depiction of mass murder. The game was initially banned from Steam Greenlight, but later reinstated after Valve's co-founder Gabe Newell apologized for the mistake. The game was also rated AO (Adults Only) by the ESRB, which means that it cannot be sold in most retail stores or on most digital platforms. The game has also been accused of being insensitive, tasteless, and potentially harmful to society.
 
Despite the negative reviews and backlash, Hatred has also gained a cult following among some gamers who enjoy its challenging gameplay, dark humor, and rebellious attitude. The game has sold over 100,000 copies on Steam, and has received several updates and patches from the developers. The game has also inspired other similar games, such as Postal Redux, IS Defense, and Hatred: Survival.
 
Hatred is a game that polarizes opinions and provokes reactions. Whether you love it or hate it, you cannot deny that it is a unique and controversial game that pushes the boundaries of video game violence. If you are curious about how Hatred plays in third person mode, you can try the Death Dealer Mod or other mods that are available on Steam Workshop or Mod DB. But be warned: this is not a game for everyone, and you should play it at your own risk.
