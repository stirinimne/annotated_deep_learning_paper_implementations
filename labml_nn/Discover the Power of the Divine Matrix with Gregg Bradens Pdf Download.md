The Divine Matrix is a book by Gregg Braden that explores the connection between science, spirituality and miracles. The book is based on a series of experiments that showed the existence of a web of energy that links everything in our lives and our world âthe Divine Matrix. Braden argues that we have the power to influence this matrix with our thoughts, feelings and beliefs, and that we can use this power to create joy, heal suffering, and bring peace to nations.

The book is divided into three parts. The first part presents the evidence for the Divine Matrix, drawing from quantum physics, ancient wisdom traditions, and modern discoveries. The second part explains how we can access the Divine Matrix and communicate with it through the language of emotion. The third part offers practical applications of the Divine Matrix in various aspects of our lives, such as health, relationships, career, and global affairs.
 
The Divine Matrix is a fascinating and inspiring book that challenges us to rethink our view of reality and our role in it. It invites us to discover the hidden potential within us and to use it for the benefit of ourselves and others.

The book has received many positive reviews from readers who found it enlightening, empowering and transformative. Some of the praises include:
 
- "This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the true nature of reality and how we can co-create it with our consciousness."
- "Gregg Braden is a brilliant writer and a visionary thinker. He connects the dots between science and spirituality in a way that is clear, compelling and inspiring."
- "The Divine Matrix is a masterpiece of synthesis and a guidebook for living in harmony with ourselves, each other and the world."

However, the book has also been criticized by some reviewers who found it lacking in scientific rigor, logical consistency and originality. Some of the criticisms include:

- "This book is full of pseudoscience, misinterpretations and wishful thinking. Braden cherry-picks his sources and ignores the evidence that contradicts his claims."
- "Gregg Braden is a poor scientist and a worse philosopher. He confuses correlation with causation, analogy with reality and belief with truth."
- "The Divine Matrix is a rehash of old ideas that have been debunked by more credible authors. Braden offers nothing new or useful to the field of spirituality or science."

Despite the mixed opinions, the book has been a bestseller and has influenced many people's views on the relationship between mind and matter. The book invites the reader to explore their own beliefs and experiences and to test the principles of the Divine Matrix for themselves.

The book also presents some of the experiments that Braden refers to as evidence for the Divine Matrix. Some of these experiments include:

- The DNA Phantom Effect: A Russian experiment that showed that human DNA can influence physical matter even when it is removed from the body and placed in a vacuum chamber. The DNA created a pattern of light that persisted even after the DNA was removed, suggesting that it left a "phantom" imprint on the space.
- The Global Consciousness Project: A worldwide network of random number generators that measure the coherence of human consciousness during global events. The project has found that the generators produce non-random patterns during times of collective emotion, such as 9/11, suggesting that human consciousness can affect physical reality.
- The Maharishi Effect: A series of studies that showed that large groups of people practicing transcendental meditation can reduce crime, violence and war in their vicinity. The studies found that when the number of meditators reached a certain threshold, the social indicators improved significantly, suggesting that human intention can create peace.

These and other experiments are explained in detail in the book, along with their implications for our understanding of ourselves and our world. Braden also offers practical exercises and techniques to help us tap into the Divine Matrix and use it for our personal and collective benefit.
