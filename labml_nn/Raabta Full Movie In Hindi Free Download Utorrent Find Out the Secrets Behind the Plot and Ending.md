> "It's not ground breaking and it's by no means perfect, but PES 2013 â more than its recent predecessors â feels like a game with a sense of identity and direction. Best of all, it offers a game of football that is both tactical and fluid; it gives you a level of control that is both demanding and rewarding." - IGN

> "Where its predecessors struggled to find a place on the current generation of consoles--often simply playing catch-up with its competitors--PES 2013 embraces its past and plays a wonderfully technical and supremely satisfying game of football." - GameSpot

> "FIFA may be at the height of its powers, a wonderful simulation of football at its most fluid and energetic, but PES 2013 is just as entertaining for different reasons. It's about keeping possession in tight spaces; it's about waiting for that perfect moment to unleash a shot; it's about individual brilliance rather than team cohesion." - Eurogamer
