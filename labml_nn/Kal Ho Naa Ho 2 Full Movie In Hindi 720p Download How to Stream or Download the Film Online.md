## Kal Ho Naa Ho 2: What to Expect from the Sequel
 
Kal Ho Naa Ho 2 is expected to be a romantic comedy-drama, similar to the genre of the original film. However, it might also have some elements of drama and suspense, as it would deal with the aftermath of Aman's death and the secrets he left behind. The sequel would also explore the themes of family, friendship, and destiny, as well as the challenges and joys of living in a multicultural society.
 
The sequel would feature some of the old characters from Kal Ho Naa Ho, such as Naina's mother Jennifer (Jaya Bachchan), her grandmother Lajjo (Sushma Seth), her friend Sweetu (Delnaaz Paul), and her neighbor Kantaben (Lillete Dubey). It would also introduce some new characters, such as Rohit's daughter Ria (who could be played by Alia Bhatt or Sara Ali Khan), her love interest Raj (who could be played by Varun Dhawan or Kartik Aaryan), and Aman's brother Arjun (who could be played by Ranbir Kapoor or Siddharth Malhotra).
 
The plot of Kal Ho Naa Ho 2 would follow Ria's journey of finding herself and her true love in New York, where she lives with her father Rohit and her godfather Aman. Ria is a cheerful and bubbly girl, who loves music and dancing. She is unaware of Aman's past and his relationship with her mother Naina, who died when she was a baby. Ria meets Raj, a charming and handsome boy, who works as a DJ at a club. They fall in love at first sight, but their romance faces many obstacles and complications. Meanwhile, Aman's brother Arjun arrives in New York, looking for answers about his brother's death. He suspects that Rohit and Aman had something to do with it, and he vows to take revenge on them. He also develops an interest in Ria, who reminds him of his brother.
 
Will Ria and Raj overcome the hurdles in their way and live happily ever after? Will Arjun find out the truth about Aman's death and forgive Rohit and Aman? Will Ria discover Aman's secret and his sacrifice for her mother? Will Rohit and Aman find peace and happiness in their lives? These are some of the questions that Kal Ho Naa Ho 2 would answer in an entertaining and emotional way.
