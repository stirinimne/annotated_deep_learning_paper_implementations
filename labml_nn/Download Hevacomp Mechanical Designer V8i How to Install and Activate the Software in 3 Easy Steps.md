In this section, we will show you some examples of how Hevacomp Mechanical Designer V8i can help you design energy efficient buildings.
 
## Example 1: Designing a Passive House
 
A passive house is a building that uses very little energy for heating and cooling, thanks to its high insulation, airtightness, and ventilation. Hevacomp Mechanical Designer V8i can help you design a passive house by:

- Calculating the heat loss and heat gain of the building envelope using the U-value method or the dynamic simulation method.
- Optimizing the orientation, shape, and size of the windows and shading devices to minimize solar heat gain and maximize daylighting.
- Designing a mechanical ventilation system with heat recovery to provide fresh air and reduce heat loss.
- Checking the compliance with the Passive House standard and generating a PHPP (Passive House Planning Package) file.

## Example 2: Retrofitting an Existing Building
 
Retrofitting an existing building is a process of improving its energy performance by upgrading its components and systems. Hevacomp Mechanical Designer V8i can help you retrofit an existing building by:

- Importing the existing building geometry from a CAD or BIM software using gbXML format.
- Performing an energy audit to identify the current energy consumption and potential savings.
- Evaluating different retrofit options, such as adding insulation, replacing windows, installing renewable energy sources, etc.
- Comparing the costs and benefits of each option and choosing the best one for your budget and goals.
- Generating an EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) to show the improvement in the energy rating of the building.

## Example 3: Designing a Net Zero Energy Building
 
A net zero energy building is a building that produces as much energy as it consumes over a year, using renewable energy sources. Hevacomp Mechanical Designer V8i can help you design a net zero energy building by:

- Optimizing the building envelope and systems to reduce the energy demand as much as possible.
- Selecting and sizing the appropriate renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, etc.
- Integrating the renewable energy sources with the grid and the building systems using smart controls and meters.
- Monitoring and verifying the energy performance of the building over time and adjusting the design if needed.
- Demonstrating the compliance with the Net Zero Energy standard and generating a NZEB (Net Zero Energy Building) certificate.
