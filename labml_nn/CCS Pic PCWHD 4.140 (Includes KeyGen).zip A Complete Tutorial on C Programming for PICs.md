## How to Use CCS PIC PCWHD 4.140
 
CCS PIC PCWHD 4.140 is a user-friendly and feature-rich IDE for PIC microcontrollers. It allows you to write code in C or assembly language, compile it to hex files, debug it using simulators or hardware tools, and program it to your PIC device. In this section, we will show you how to use CCS PIC PCWHD 4.140 for a simple project.
 
### Step 1: Create a New Project
 
To create a new project in CCS PIC PCWHD 4.140, you need to click on the "File" menu and choose "New Project". A dialog box will appear where you can enter the name of your project, choose the location of your project folder, select the type of your project (C or assembly), and specify the target device (PIC model) and compiler options. Click on "OK" and your project will be created.
 
You will see a window with two panes: the left pane shows the files and folders in your project, and the right pane shows the code editor where you can write your code. By default, a main file with the same name as your project will be created and opened in the code editor. You can also add new files or existing files to your project by right-clicking on the project name in the left pane and choosing "Add File" or "Add Existing File".
 
### Step 2: Write Your Code
 
To write your code in CCS PIC PCWHD 4.140, you can use the code editor in the right pane. The code editor has syntax highlighting, auto-completion, code folding, bookmarks, line numbers, and other features that make coding easier and faster. You can also use the built-in help system to access the reference manuals, datasheets, examples, and tutorials for your PIC device and compiler.
 
For this example, we will write a simple C program that blinks an LED connected to pin RB0 of a PIC16F877A microcontroller. The code is as follows:
 `#include <16F877A.h> //include header file for PIC16F877A
#fuses HS,NOWDT,NOPROTECT,NOLVP //set fuses for high-speed oscillator, no watchdog timer, no code protection, no low-voltage programming
#use delay(clock=20000000) //set clock frequency to 20 MHz

void main() //main function

   set_tris_b(0x00); //set port B as output
   while(1) //infinite loop
   
      output_high(PIN_B0); //turn on LED
      delay_ms(500); //wait for 500 milliseconds
      output_low(PIN_B0); //turn off LED
      delay_ms(500); //wait for 500 milliseconds

` 
You can save your code by clicking on the "File" menu and choosing "Save" or "Save All". You can also use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+S or Ctrl+Shift+S.
 
### Step 3: Compile Your Code
 
To compile your code in CCS PIC PCWHD 4.140, you need to click on the "Project" menu and choose "Build All". A dialog box will appear where you can see the progress and status of the compilation process. If there are no errors or warnings in your code, you will see a message that says "Build Succeeded" and a hex file with the same name as your project will be generated in your project folder.
 
If there are any errors or warnings in your code, you will see a message that says "Build Failed" and a list of errors or warnings will be displayed in the bottom pane. You can double-click on any error or warning to jump to the line of code where it occurred. You can also use the "Next Error" and "Previous Error" buttons to navigate through the errors or warnings. You need to fix all the errors before you can compile your code successfully.
 
### Step 4: Debug Your Code
 
To debug your code in CCS PIC PCWHD 4.140, you have two options: using a simulator or using a hardware tool. A simulator is a software that mimics the behavior of your PIC device and allows you to test your code without connecting it to a real device. A hardware tool is a device that connects to
