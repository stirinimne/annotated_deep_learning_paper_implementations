Lumion 6 Pro is a user-friendly and intuitive software that can help you create stunning 3D renderings in minutes. However, there are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your skills and achieve better results with Lumion 6 Pro. Here are some of them:

- Use Lumion styles to quickly apply a preset look to your scene. Lumion styles are a collection of effects that can enhance the mood and atmosphere of your renderings. You can choose from various styles such as realistic, sketch, artistic, night, dawn and more. You can also customize and save your own styles for future use[^1^].
- Align your verticals to correct the perspective distortion of your camera. Lumion has a handy tool that can automatically align the vertical lines of your buildings and structures to make them look more realistic and natural. You can find this tool under the Photo/Movie mode, in the Camera settings tab[^1^].
- Improve your reflections with PureGlass and SpeedRay effects. Lumion 6 Pro has two effects that can enhance the quality and realism of your reflections on glass and water surfaces. PureGlass can create transparent, translucent and frosted glass effects with accurate light refraction. SpeedRay can add real-time reflections to curved and planar surfaces without affecting the performance[^2^].
- Adjust your focal length to change the depth of field and field of view of your camera. Lumion 6 Pro allows you to change the focal length of your camera from 15mm to 150mm. This can affect how much of your scene is in focus and how much distortion is applied to the edges of your image. You can use a lower focal length for wide-angle shots and a higher focal length for close-ups and details[^1^].
- Explore the library of assets to enrich your scene with objects, materials, lights and sounds. Lumion 6 Pro has a vast library of assets that you can use to populate and decorate your scene. You can find thousands of objects such as furniture, vehicles, plants, people, animals and more. You can also apply hundreds of materials such as wood, metal, stone, fabric and more. You can also add lights and sounds to create a more immersive experience[^2^].
