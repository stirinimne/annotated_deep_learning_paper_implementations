# Quixel NDo2 116 64bit 12: A Powerful Tool for Normal Map Creation in Photoshop
 
Quixel NDo2 is a Photoshop plug-in that allows you to create normal maps from any image or layer using Photoshop's standard tools. Normal maps are used to add realistic details and depth to 3D models without increasing the polygon count. With Quixel NDo2, you can easily sculpt, paint, rotate, and tweak your normal maps in a 3D previewer inside Photoshop.
 
Quixel NDo2 116 64bit 12 is the latest version of the plug-in, which has been improved and optimized for performance and compatibility. It supports Normal to Ambient Occlusion conversion, full 3D normals, true rotations, custom curves for designing bevels, normal sculpting, and layer compression. It also works with Metahumans, Unreal Engine's new tool for creating realistic digital humans.

Quixel NDo2 is not the only tool that Quixel offers for normal map creation. Quixel also has Mixer, a standalone application that lets you create and edit textures, materials, and normal maps using Megascans assets and custom brushes. Mixer has a powerful painting system that allows you to paint directly on your 3D model with layers and masks. You can also use Mixer to blend and mix different materials and textures to create unique and realistic surfaces.
 
Another tool that Quixel has for normal map creation is dDo, a Photoshop plug-in that automates the process of generating textures and normal maps from a single diffuse map. dDo uses smart presets and algorithms to analyze your diffuse map and create realistic details and variations. You can also customize and tweak the results using Photoshop's tools and layers. dDo is ideal for creating textures and normal maps for organic and hard-surface models.
 
Quixel NDo2, Mixer, and dDo are all part of Quixel's suite of tools that aim to make 3D world-building easy and accessible for everyone. Quixel's tools are compatible with most 3D software and game engines, such as Maya, Blender, 3ds Max, ZBrush, Unity, Unreal Engine, and more. Quixel's tools are also constantly updated and improved to meet the needs and expectations of the 3D community.
